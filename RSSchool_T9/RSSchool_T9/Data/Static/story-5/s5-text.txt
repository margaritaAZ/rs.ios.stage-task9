Petanque is a sport. The current form of the game originated in 1907 or 1910 in La Ciotat, in Provence, France. The French name petanque (borrowed into English, with or without the acute accent) comes from petanca in the Provencal dialect of the Occitan language, deriving from the expression pe tancat, meaning 'foot fixed' or 'foot planted' (on the ground).

In petanque the objective is to score points by having boules closer to the target than the opponent after all boules have been thrown. This is achieved by throwing or rolling boules closer to the small target ball, officially called a jack but known colloquially as a cochonnet, or by hitting the opponents' boules away from the target, while standing inside a circle with both feet on the ground.

The game is normally and best played on hard dirt or gravel. It can be played in public areas in parks or in dedicated facilities called boulodromes.
